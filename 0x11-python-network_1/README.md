## Introduction
This repository contains a series of tasks that are aimed at teaching you how to use Python to handle web requests and process web data.

We will learn how to use the `urllib` module and the `requests` module to send HTTP requests to web servers, and how to process the responses from those servers.

## Tasks
Here are the tasks included in this repository.

### [0. What's my status? #0](./0-hbtn_status.py)
Write a Python script that fetches `https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status`

### [1. Response header value #0](./1-hbtn_header.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the `X-Request-Id` variable found in the header of the response.

### [2. POST an email #0](./2-post_email.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a `POST` request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response.

### [3. Error code #0](./3-error_code.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response. If the HTTP status code is greater than or equal to `400`, the script should print: `Error code:` followed by the value of the HTTP status code.

### [4. What's my status? #1](./4-hbtn_status.py)
Write a Python script that fetches `https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status`. Using the package `requests`.

### [5. Response header value #1](./5-hbtn_header.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the variable `X-Request-Id` in the response header, using the package `requests`.

### [6. POST an email #1](./6-post_email.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a `POST` request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response, using the package `requests`.

### [7. Error code #1](./7-error_code.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response. If the HTTP status code is greater than or equal to `400`, the script should print: `Error code:` followed by the value of the HTTP status code, using the package `requests`.

### [8. Search API](./8-json_api.py)
Write a Python script that takes in a letter and sends a `POST` request to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user` with the letter as a parameter. If no data is provided, print `No result` or `Not a valid JSON` if the JSON is not valid.

### [9. My Github!](./9-starwars.py)
Write a Python script that takes your Github credentials (username and password) and uses the Github API to display your `id`.

### [10. Time for an interview!](./10-my_github.py)
Write a Python script that takes your Github credentials (username and password) and uses the Github API to display your `id`.

## How to Use
To use any of the Python scripts in this repository, you must have Python 3 installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickolumba/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```
2. `cd` into the directory of the desired task
```bash
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x11-python-network_1
```
3. Run the Python script with Python 3
```bash
python3 <filename>
```
